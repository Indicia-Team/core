Notes:
1) Branch/country level summarisation to be done in front end (by summing up the locations)
2) Row and column totals in each grid done by the front end

Proposed development path
1) Currently only week based summarisation, as that is what UKBMS want. Expand to allow Month based summarisation
2) Allow >1 summarisation per survey
3) Currently deals with super/subsample with locations, as that is what UKBMS want. Expand to handle other cases.
4) Amalgamation of raw data into a daily summary. Would need to store sample list.
5) Make 0-1 rounding configurable
6) Configurable end of year processing: Include data for overlap, include periods that overlap
