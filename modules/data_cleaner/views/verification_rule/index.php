<p>Verification rules can be created by uploading files that are compatible with the NBN Record Cleaner.
For more information on creating these files, see
<a href="https://nbn.org.uk/tools-and-resources/nbn-toolbox/nbn-record-cleaner/">
NBN Record Cleaner on the NBN website.</a>. You can either use the online file servers
as used by NBN Record Cleaner to obtain rules or zip your files into a batch to upload. Alternatively you can create
a CSV file containing one column per property in a rule file and one row per rule to upload. Column titles
must exactly match the name of the section, followed by a colon, then the name of the attribute, e.g.
a column Data:StartDate contains the start date for a PeriodWithinYear check. The CSV file should therefore
contain a column called Metadata:TestType containing the rule name e.g. Period or PeriodWithinYear. Finally
the CSV file should contain a RuleID column containing a unique reference for every row for the rule being created,
allowing future file uploads to replace existing rules if they have the same rule ID.</p>
